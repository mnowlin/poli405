## Punctuated Equilibrium 

### Theoretical Antecedents

* Incrementalism (Lindblom)
	* Time constraints and/or political limitations prevent full (rational) consideration of policy issues 
	* Policymakers rely on past decisions resulting in a policy process of small, incremental adjustments 
	* Policymakers start from existing baseline and make adjustments based on pressures from the current environment

* Expansion of conflict (Schattschneider 1960) 
	* Loser appeal: losers in policy conflicts attempt to expand conflict 
	* Concerned outsiders
	* Jurisdictional expansion 

* Issue Definitions 

* Agenda Setting 


###  Punctuated Equilibrium Process

* Policymaking makes leaps and undergoes periods of near stasis as issues emerge on and recede from the public (macro) agenda 
	* Incrementalism does not allow for rapid policy change, which often occurs
	* The interaction of a policy image with political institutions (i.e., policy venues) 

* American political institutions exacerbate the tendency toward punctuated equilibria 
	* Policy Venues: Political institutions that have jurisdiction over certain policy issues (or aspects of policy issues)

* Policy images play a critical role in expanding issues from subsystems to the public (macro) agenda 
	* The ways an issue is defined; positive or negative
	* Mixture of empirical information and emotive appeals 

###  Punctuated Equilibrium Components 

* Macropolitics is the politics of punctuation 
	* Large-scale change, competing policy images, political manipulation, and positive feedback 

* Subsystem politics is the politics of equilibrium 
	* Policy monopoly, incrementalism, widely accepted and positive image, and negative feedback

* Boundedly rational foundations
	* Punctuations occur as a result of change in preferences or change in attention

###  Punctuated Equilibrium

* _Policy subsystem_ dynamics
 
* Negative feedback 
	* Pressure exerted by strategies of those that favor the status quo to maintain the current policy image and venue authority (i.e., institutional arraignments)
	* Contain conflict 

* Positive feedback: 
	* Pressure exerted by those that favor policy change. These include policy entrepreneurs attempting to re-frame an issue and other policy venues attempting to claim jurisdiction
	* Expand conflict 

### Example: Government Budgets
 
* A function of exogenous and endogenous pressure 
	
* "Earthquake" budget 
	* Many minuscule real changes, a few moderate changes, and many large changes 
 
* Leptokurtic distribution
	* Large slender central peak (representing stability) 
	* Weak shoulders (moderate changes)
	* Big tails (punctuations)
