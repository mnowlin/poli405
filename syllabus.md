# Course Description

[Catalog course description](https://ssb.cofc.edu:9710/prod/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=201520&one_subj=POLI&sel_crse_strt=405&sel_crse_end=405&sel_subj=&sel_levl=&sel_schd=&sel_coll=&sel_divs=&sel_dept=&sel_attr=) 

_Our responsibility is one of decision--for to govern is to choose. - John F. Kennedy_

As stated by President Kennedy, making choices is at the heart of governing. How do policymakers make choices regarding public policy? From where do policymakers draw information? How do policymaking institutions help or hinder the processing of information for policy making? These are the questions that we will examine this semester.

The Capstone seminar in Political Science is designed to be a culminating experience. Therefore, you will be expected to draw upon the ideas and skills you have gained thus far to explore a new topic within the field of Political Science. The major focus of the course is on the development of an original research project centered around questions of information use in the policymaking process. The readings in this course are designed to provide you the theoretical and conceptual background needed to develop a project in this area. 

This course will be structured as a seminar, meaning that classes will be discussion based rather than lecture based. This requires you to come to class prepared by having done the assigned readings prior to class. In addition, you should be prepared to participate in class by asking questions and making informed comments that add to the class discussion. _Cell phones must be put away during class and the use of laptops for note-taking is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED_. 

# Course Goals and Learning Objectives

The goals for this course are to:

* Develop an understanding of the major policymaking institutions
  including the Congress, the President, Executive Agencies, the
  Courts, and how they use information. 

* Develop an understanding of the process of policymaking in the
  U.S. and the utilization of information within that process.

* Develop an understanding of the latest research in Political Science and public policy on information use in the policymaking process.

* Develop a research project that draws on the skills you have developed in your Political Science courses.

* Develop in--depth knowledge about a particular policy topic or issue. 

* Practice effective oral presentations of independent research.

# Course Requirements and Grading

Performance in this course will be based on course participation and the research project. As part of your participation grade, you will be assigned several discussion papers that summarize the readings for that week. 

## Assignments

_Participation_ (30 points): 

* _Discussion papers_ (24 points): As part of your participation grade you are required to do several discussion papers over the readings assigned for each week. These are _short_ papers (not more than two double-spaced pages) that summarize the major concepts in the readings. These will generally be due before class on Tuesdays and due dates will be on the [course webpage](http://mnowlin.github.io/poli405/). __Late papers will not be accepted__. 

* _In-class participation_ (6 points): This is a discussion based course and to make it work you need to have read assigned material and be prepared to participate in course discussions. Note that the professor has final say over what does or does not count as adequate participation.

_Research project_ (70 points): Over the course of the semester, you will undertake an independent research project that deals with the use of information in the policymaking process. The research project should deal with a specific policy issue or area of your choice (e.g., climate change, poverty). You should make use of the [Policy Agendas Project](http://www.policyagendas.org/) website and the classification of policy topics and sub-topics when deciding on your policy area. More detail about the research project will be posted on the [course webpage](http://mnowlin.github.io/poli405/). The following pieces of the research project will be due throughout the semester.

* Topic (Policy area) Selection and Bibliography (10 points)
* Research Design (5 points)

## Students with Disabilities:
The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. Students should apply at the [Center for
Disability Services](http://disabilityservices.cofc.edu/) located on the first floor of the Lightsey Center, Suite 104. Students approved for accommodations are responsible for notifying me as soon as possible and for contacting me at least one week before any accommodation is needed. 
 
## Cheating or Plagiarism:
A grade of zero will be given to anyone cheating on any exam, homework
assignment or committing plagiarism in a paper. As commonly defined,
plagiarism consists of passing off as ones own ideas, the words,
writings, music, graphs/charts, etc that were created by another. In
accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you
copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if
you have the permission of that person.  It does not matter from where
the material is borrowed–a book, article, material off the web,
another student’s paper–all constitute plagiarism unless the source of
the work is fully identified and credited. Plagiarism is cheating and
a violation of academic and personal integrity and will not be
tolerated.  It carries extremely serious consequences.  To avoid
plagiarism it is necessary when using a phrase, a distinctive idea,
concept or sentence from another source to reference that source in
your text, a footnote, or end-note.  Please contact me if you need
assistance in citing a source. 

## Religious Holiday Policy:
It is the policy of the College to excuse absences of students that
result from religious observances and to provide without penalty for
the rescheduling of examinations and additional required class work
that may fall on religious holidays.  Please see me
immediately if you will need to miss class any time during this
semester.
