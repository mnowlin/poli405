## Students with Disabilities:
The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. Students should apply at the [Center for
Disability Services](http://disabilityservices.cofc.edu/) located on the first floor of the Lightsey Center, Suite 104. Students approved for accommodations are responsible for notifying me as soon as possible and for contacting me at least one week before any accommodation is needed. 
 
## Cheating or Plagiarism:
A grade of zero will be given to anyone cheating on any exam, homework
assignment or committing plagiarism in a paper. As commonly defined,
plagiarism consists of passing off as ones own ideas, the words,
writings, music, graphs/charts, etc that were created by another. In
accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you
copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if
you have the permission of that person.  It does not matter from where
the material is borrowed–a book, article, material off the web,
another student’s paper–all constitute plagiarism unless the source of
the work is fully identified and credited. Plagiarism is cheating and
a violation of academic and personal integrity and will not be
tolerated.  It carries extremely serious consequences.  To avoid
plagiarism it is necessary when using a phrase, a distinctive idea,
concept or sentence from another source to reference that source in
your text, a footnote, or end-note.  Please contact me if you need
assistance in citing a source. 

## Religious Holiday Policy:
It is the policy of the College to excuse absences of students that
result from religious observances and to provide without penalty for
the rescheduling of examinations and additional required class work
that may fall on religious holidays.  Please see me
immediately if you will need to miss class any time during this
semester.
