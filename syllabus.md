# Course Description

[Catalog course description](https://ssb.cofc.edu:9710/prod/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=201520&one_subj=POLI&sel_crse_strt=307&sel_crse_end=307&sel_subj=&sel_levl=&sel_schd=&sel_coll=&sel_divs=&sel_dept=&sel_attr=) 

This course is an advanced undergraduate course.  We will examine the
central dimensions of environmental politics and policy in the United
States.

The course will provide an overview of the development of environmental policy issues, including a brief history on the develop of environmental politics in the U.S. In addition, the course will also provide a theoretical base for understanding policy changes in the U. S. Major portions of the course will be devoted to examining the fundamental beliefs and attitudes that
have shaped environmental policies; the major political institutions in the U.S. that conceive, design, implement, and revise environmental policies; the role of science and risk assessment in environmental policy; and the application of economic principles to environmental issues.

The format of the course will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and group work. Students should come to each class prepared to participate in discussion. This means you have reviewed your notes from previous classes and have read the readings in advance of class. You are encouraged to bring your internet capable device (laptop, tablet, smart--phone) to class for discussion and group work, _however these devices are not to be used in a way that is distracting to your professor or your classmates_

# Course Goals and Learning Objectives

The goals for this course are to:

* Develop an understanding of the evolution of environmental
  policy and politics in the U.S. 

* Develop an understanding of the major policymaking institutions
  including the Congress, the President, Executive Agencies, the
  Courts, and their role in environmental policymaking. 

* Develop an understanding of the process of policymaking in the
  U.S. with regard to environmental issues. 

* Develop an understanding of how science is used (or not) in the
  environmental policy making process. 

* Develop an understanding of how basic principles of economics
  can be used in the design of policies to address environmental
  issues. 

* Develop in--depth knowledge about a particular topic within the
  broad field of environmental policy. 

# Course Requirements and Grading

Performance in this course will be evaluated on the basis of three papers, a mid--term exam, final exam (presentation), and your participation in the course.

Points will be distributed as follows:

* Readings Quizzes: (5 @20 pts each) 100 points
* Paper 1: 100 points 
* Paper 2: 100 points 
* Paper 3: 100 points 
* Mid--Term Exam: 100 points 
* Final Exam (presentation): 100 points 
* Participation: 100 points 
* _Total: 700 points_

## Assignments

_Reading Quizzes_: There will be five "pop" reading quizzes throughout the semester. These quizzes will be given randomally in class. They will cover the assigned reading for the week (see the schedule below) and can only be taken in class. __No make-up quizzes will be possible__. 

_Papers_: Papers will be expected to be the equivalent of 3--4 double spaced
pages, with 1" margins, and 12-point Times New Roman font. Because
the papers are short, I will expect well organized, clear, concise, and professional quality writing. Full and appropriate citations are expected, with any citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago) you prefer. Consider making use of the [Writing Lab](http://csl.cofc.edu/labs/writing-lab) available on campus. More information about the requirements, including due date, for each paper are under the Assignments tab on the course homepage. Note that paper 3 will include papers 1 and 2. __No late papers will be accepted__. 

_Mid-term_: The mid-term exam will be given on __February 26th__. All material from the readings, lectures, media articles, and in-class discussions are fair game for the mid-term exam.

_Final Exam_: The final exam will consist of a presentation of the topic you explored for your papers. The presentations will be given during the scheduled time for the final exam. You will only have 5 minutes for your presentation, so it needs to be consise and informative.

_Participation_: The participation portion of your grade is based on in--class participation, participation (attendance) in on--campus lectures/events related to environmental policy broadly defined, and class attendance.

* __In-class participation (40%)__: This is a discussion based course and to make it work you need to have read assigned material and be prepared to participate in course discussions. Each week you will write 4 or 5 sentences on a quiz in OAKS about how you contributed to in--class discussion and these quizzes will form the basis of your in--class participation grade. Note that the professor has final say over what does or does not count as adequate participation.

* __Campus participation (40%)__: For the campus participation portion you must attend three lectures/events outside of class and to submit a one page
response to EACH event/lecture linking the topic of the event/lecture
to a class reading/discussion. The lectures/events are __subject to
instructor approval__ and will be announced in class. Students may 
also suggest on--campus events that they feel would be appropriate, but
prior approval must be obtained. 

* __Attendance (20%)__: Attendance will be taken for each class. 

## Grades 
There are __700__ possible points for this course. Grades will
be allocated based on your earned points and calculated as a
percentage of __700__. 

* A: 94 to 100% 
* A-: 90 to 93% 
* B+: 87 to 89%

## Students with Disabilities:
The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. Students should apply at the [Center for
Disability Services](http://disabilityservices.cofc.edu/) located on the first floor of the Lightsey Center, Suite 104. Students approved for accommodations are responsible for notifying me as soon as possible and for contacting me at least one week before any accommodation is needed. 
 
## Cheating or Plagiarism:
A grade of zero will be given to anyone cheating on any exam, homework
assignment or committing plagiarism in a paper. As commonly defined,
plagiarism consists of passing off as ones own ideas, the words,
writings, music, graphs/charts, etc that were created by another. In
accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you
copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if
you have the permission of that person.  It does not matter from where
the material is borrowed–a book, article, material off the web,
another student’s paper–all constitute plagiarism unless the source of
the work is fully identified and credited. Plagiarism is cheating and
a violation of academic and personal integrity and will not be
tolerated.  It carries extremely serious consequences.  To avoid
plagiarism it is necessary when using a phrase, a distinctive idea,
concept or sentence from another source to reference that source in
your text, a footnote, or end-note.  Please contact me if you need
assistance in citing a source. 

## Religious Holiday Policy:
It is the policy of the College to excuse absences of students that
result from religious observances and to provide without penalty for
the rescheduling of examinations and additional required class work
that may fall on religious holidays.  Please see me
immediately if you will need to miss class any time during this
semester.
